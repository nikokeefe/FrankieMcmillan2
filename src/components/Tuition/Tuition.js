					I have taught creative writing in a number of community settings
					including ARA Christchurch, Arts Council workshops, penal institutions
					etc. I particularly enjoy teaching short fiction. Workshop options
					include 2 hour, 4 hour and weekend sessions. My teaching style is
					focused but relaxed and ' hands on'.
